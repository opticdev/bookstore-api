# Bookstore API

Bookstore API built using Fastify and Typescript with Optic. Generates an OpenAPI spec using `@fastify/swagger` and tracks changes using Optic. To run this locally, you will need [node >= 16](https://nodejs.org/en) and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install).

Get started by installing dependencies:

`yarn install`

And then run one of the following commands:
- `yarn start:local` - starts the server
- `yarn generate-spec` - generates an OpenAPI spec from code definitions
